## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- JavaScript
- Responsive

### What I learned

This was a fun and challenging project. I learned a lot about responsiveness. I tried my best to stay away from fix-sizes.

- Clamp()
- min-content / max-content / fit-content
- max-content /min-content
- min-width / max-width
- min-height
- DOM traversing

### Continued development

There are room for improvement for the project. I think the navigation can be a little more fluid. Right now, at a mobile version, the "feature" and "company" height are fixed. So when you opened it, there is a empty white space below it. I want it to expand and shrink as the user click.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - I learned a lot from Kevin regarding responsive. He has a 21 days course for responsive design, which I think is extremely helpful. Definitely recommended. His youtube channel is full of useful tip/tricks and modern CSS styling. I really enjoy learning from him.
